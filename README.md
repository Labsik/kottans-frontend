### What was new
* Now I know a lot things about **forking** and have practice experience
* Also it useful to be familiar with ``` git rebase ```
* After this lesson I will not lost in github interface. I know about **fork**, **star**, **issues** and **CONTRIBUTING.md** file


I think, everything from this lesson I`ll use in the future.
